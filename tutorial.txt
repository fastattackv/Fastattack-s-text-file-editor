I hope you will enjoy using this text editor


FILE MENU:
- New (CTRL + n):
   This functionnality opens a "save as" window to create a new file. To create a file just navigate to the folder you want to create the file and name it. If you do not add an extension to the file, it will
   automaticaly be set as".txt". To create a file without extension add a "." at the end of the file name.

- Load (CTRL + l):
   This functionnality opens a "open" window to select the file to load. Even if the loading is aborted, any opened file will be closed.

- Save (CTRL + s):
   This functionnality saves the entered text to the loaded file. If no files are loaded: a "save as" window will open to save the file. If you delete a file while it's opened, saving will recreate the file.

- Switch edition mode (CTRL + e):
  This functionnality allows you to switch to the readonly mode, in this state you cannot edit the entered text (this tutorial file should be oppened in this mode) but you can still use functionnalities like
   search. You can only use the readonly mode when a file is loaded. To see if you are in readonly mode, just look at the window's title, it should indicate it. To switch back to the normal mode, just click the
   button once more. Certain files (like the tutorial one) are "forced readonly" and cannot be modified.

- Close (no binding):
   This functionnality closes the opened file. If the opened file isn't saved, the text editor will ask you if you want to save it.
